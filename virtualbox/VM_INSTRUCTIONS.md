# Running AndyOS Virtual Preview

This guide explains how to run the AndyOS Virtual Preview on your computer using VirtualBox.

## Option 1: VirtualBox (Recommended)

1. **Install VirtualBox**: Ensure you have [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) installed.
2. **Import Configuration**:
   - Open VirtualBox.
   - Go to `Machine > Add...`
   - Select the `virtualbox/AndyOS.vbox` file from this project.
3. **Run the Preview**:
   - Double-click the "AndyOS" entry in VirtualBox.
   - *Note*: This VM is pre-configured for the AndyOS experience. Since this is a "level" of AndyOS, it will launch the visual preview environment.

## Option 2: Web Preview (Easiest)

If you don't want to use a VM, you can run the interactive AndyOS simulation directly in your browser:

1. Navigate to the `preview/` folder.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

## Key Features to Explore
- **Setup Wizard**: Experience the "Privacy First" onboarding flow.
- **Privacy Guard**: Explore the security dashboard where you can toggle tracker blocking and firewalls.
- **Visual Design**: Note the premium glassmorphism and deep-teal aesthetics that define the AndyOS user experience.
